/**
 * Represents a team member (employee/staff) associated with a store.
 * Allows multiple users to collaborate on managing a single store with different permission levels.
 * Each team member has a role that determines their access and capabilities.
 * **Key Fields:**
 * - `id`: Unique identifier (CUID)
 * - `userId`: Reference to the User who is a team member
 * - `storeId`: Reference to the Store they belong to
 * - `role`: Permission level (OWNER, ADMIN, MANAGER, STAFF)
 * **Relationships:**
 * - Belongs to one User
 * - Belongs to one Store
 * **Business Logic:**
 * - A user can be a team member of multiple stores
 * - Roles define permission levels: OWNER (full access), ADMIN (management), MANAGER (operations), STAFF (limited)
 * - When a user is deleted, their team member records are cascade deleted
 * - When a store is deleted, all team member associations are cascade deleted
